# react-app
This is a react app without the boiler plate. Best for basic projects.
Create a folder and navigate to it and use the following commands

For windows

```
git clone https://github.com/SarthakNarayan/react-app.git .
npm install
rmdir /s /q .git
```

For linux

```
git clone https://github.com/SarthakNarayan/react-app.git .
rm -rf .git && npm install
```

Don't forget to change the name in package.json with the name of your current folder
